# Medical-image-denoising
Medical images are often acquired in noisy environments, leading to the presence of unwanted artifacts and inconsistencies. Denoising is the process of removing noise while preserving the important structures and details in the image. This repository provides an implementation of a denoising algorithm specifically designed for medical images.
